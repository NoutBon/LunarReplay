With this version of the Lunar Client launcher, you can launch ReplayMod using the version module I have made. However, please note that I am still working on improving it. Currently, the only versions compatible with ReplayMod are 1.8.9 and 1.12.2, so for now, you will have to use 1.8.9. Also, it's important to take note that this is an older build of Lunar Client from August.

### Setting up
To download the `app.asar` file, head over to the releases section. Once downloaded, locate the Lunar Client launcher on your desktop and right-click on it. From there, click on "Properties" and click on "Open File Location". Afterwards go inside the resources folder where you will need to rename the current app.asar file, something like `app.backup.asar` will do. It's important in case you want to switch back to the original launcher. Next, drag in the new app.asar file into the resources folder. Congratulations, you have completed the setup!

### Is it not working?
Try deleting everything inside of your multiver folder in `.lunarclient/offline`, and extract everything from this zip folder https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nkitw4wqRj2ziahjWnD8cY2wJACo37Dj/view.
